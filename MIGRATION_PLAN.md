4. Add event recurrence
5. Implement reminders
6. Add integration tests

### 2.4 AI Assistant Feature
Current location: `src/components/AiGuideWithOllama.tsx`
Target location: `src/features/ai-assistant/`

Steps:
1. Move AI components to feature folder
2. Create AI service abstraction
3. Implement provider pattern for multiple LLMs
4. Add conversation history
5. Create prompt templates

### 4.3 Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Create analytics feature module
- [ ] Build charts and visualizations
- [ ] Add family insights
- [ ] Create progress reports
- [ ] Implement export functionality

## Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Week 7)

### 5.1 Performance
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add caching strategies
- [ ] Profile and fix bottlenecks

### 5.2 User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Add help system
- [ ] Improve accessibility

### 5.3 Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add E2E tests
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add API documentation

## Migration Checklist

For each component migration:

- [ ] Extract logic to service
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Build new components
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Update imports in parent components
- [ ] Test integration
- [ ] Update documentation

## Code Migration Example

### Before (Current Code):
```typescript
// In FamilyDashboard.tsx
const [choreEntries, setChoreEntries] = useState<any[]>([]);

const handleChoreSubmit = () => {
  // Inline logic
};
```

### After (New Architecture):
```typescript
// In features/chores/hooks/useChores.ts
export const useChores = () => {
  const choreService = ChoreService.getInstance();
  const [chores, setChores] = useState<Chore[]>([]);
  
  const addChore = async (chore: ChoreInput) => {
    try {
      const newChore = await choreService.addChore(chore);
      setChores([...chores, newChore]);
      return newChore;
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(error);
    }
  };
  
  return { chores, addChore };
};
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep old components during migration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain data format compatibility
- Test thoroughly before removing old code

### Data Migration
- Create backup before migration
- Write migration scripts
- Test with sample data
- Have rollback plan ready

### User Impact
- Migrate during low usage times
- Communicate changes to users
- Provide migration guide
- Keep UI familiar during transition

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Reduced complexity, better type safety
- **Performance**: Faster load times, smoother interactions
- **Maintainability**: Easier to add features, fix bugs
- **Test Coverage**: >80% coverage
- **User Satisfaction**: No regression in functionality

## Timeline

- Week 1: Foundation setup
- Week 2-3: Core feature migration
- Week 4: Integration enhancement
- Week 5-6: New features
- Week 7: Polish and optimization
- Week 8: Deployment and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create feature branches
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule regular progress reviews
