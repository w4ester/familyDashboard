# Testing File System Server

This file was created through the MCP filesystem server to demonstrate how Claude can interact with local files.

## What's Happening

1. Claude received a request to create this file
2. Claude used the `write_file` function to send content to the MCP filesystem server
3. The MCP server wrote this content to the specified path
4. You're now reading the result!

## Technical Details

- **File path**: `/Users/willf/smartIndex/siguy/family-dashboard/testingFileSystemServerLogs.md`
- **Created**: Tuesday, May 13, 2025
- **Purpose**: Demonstration of MCP filesystem capabilities
- **MCP Protocol**: Allows AI assistants like Claude to read and write files on your local system

## Applications

This capability allows Claude to:
- Create and edit project files
- Save notes and research
- Generate documentation
- Modify configuration files
- Work with data stored on your computer

All operations require your explicit permission and only work with directories you've specifically allowed in your MCP server configuration.
